        <h2>What is Jaun Iudsutries?</h2>
        <p>Juan Industries orginated as a small skate crew that my good friend and I made back in 2015. It is sort of a play on a pre-exsisting 
        skate company called <b>"World Industries"</b> and the fact that my dad's name is Juan. Now that time has passed and the members of the crew and I have
        gone our seperate ways, I have realized that the name is too good to go to waste. I now see it as a name that can hold all random creative 
    ideas I have. I still have not decided what I'm going to do with this website. Do I treat it as a blog, or do I use this website 
    as a portfolio of all my software related projects I have for the future. I guess we will find out.</p>
