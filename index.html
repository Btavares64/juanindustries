    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Juan Industries orginates as a small skate crew that me and my good friend made back in 2015. Itis sort of a play on a pre-exsisting 
      skate company called <b>"world industries"</b> and the fact that my dad name is Juan. Now that time has past and the members of the crew and I have
    gone our seperate ways, I have realized that the name is too good to go to waste. I now see it as a name that can hold all random creative 
  ideas I have. For this website, it is still currently undecided on what im going to do with it. Do I treat it as a blog? Or do I use this website 
as a portfolio on all my software related projects I have for the future. I guess we will find out</p>
